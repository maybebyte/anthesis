					<h2 id="what-is-nixos">What is NixOS and why might you use it?</h2>

					<p>
					<a href="https://nixos.org/" hreflang="en">NixOS</a>
					is a unique Linux distribution. The main thing that
					makes NixOS special is the ability to describe your
					desired system layout with the Nix language. To do
					this, you edit a file named
					<code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> and then
					rebuild the system.
					</p>

					<p>
					Declarative package management and system
					configuration have some benefits over the imperative
					approach used by more traditional operating systems.
					But to meaningfully review the pros and cons of
					NixOS, we must first understand these terms and how
					they relate to one another.
					</p>

					<p>
					If you already know the differences between them,
					<a href="#nixos-advantages">feel free to skip ahead</a>.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2 id="imperative-vs-declarative">What do imperative and declarative mean?</h2>

					<p>
					The easiest way for me to explain these two concepts
					is to talk about them in the context of software
					development.
					</p>

					<p>
					<em>Imperative</em> programming languages are things
					like Python and C. To make languages like this
					useful, you provide step-by-step instructions that
					lead to your end goal. In other words,
					<strong>imperative means you write out how to do something</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>
					Meanwhile, Haskell and Nix are examples of
					<em>declarative</em> programming languages. Their
					design allows them to perform the necessary steps on
					their own when given a proper description. In other
					words,
					<strong>declarative means you describe what the end result should be</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>
					Let&#8217;s compare the process of activating an SSH
					service on Arch Linux and NixOS to demonstrate the
					differences between these two paradigms.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 id="enable-ssh-arch">Enable SSH imperatively</h3>

					<ol>
						<li>
						<p>
						Install the <code>openssh</code> package.
						</p>
						<pre># <kbd>pacman -S openssh</kbd></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						Enable the service.
						</p>
						<pre># <kbd>systemctl enable ssh</kbd></pre>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 id="enable-ssh-nixos">Enable SSH declaratively</h3>

					<ol>
						<li>
						<p>
						Edit the
						<code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> file.
						</p>
						<pre><kbd>services.sshd.enable = true;</kbd></pre>
						</li>

						<li>
						<p>
						Rebuild and switch to the new configuration.
						During the build, NixOS detects that the
						<code>sshd</code> service depends on the
						<code>openssh</code> package, so it installs it.
						</p>
						<pre># <kbd>nixos-rebuild switch</kbd></pre>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<section>
						<h3 id="abstraction">Pro #1: Abstraction</h3>

						<p>
						The nice thing about NixOS is that a lot of
						different software can be configured using the
						same syntax. Compare the way that default fonts
						are set in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
						to the Nix expression.
						</p>

						<p>
						You may notice that the XML sample only defines
						serif. Yet right below it, Nix is able to
						declare default serif, sans-serif, and monospace
						fonts in less space.
						</p>

						<pre><code>&#60;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39;?&#62;
&#60;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM &#39;fonts.dtd&#39;&#62;
&#60;fontconfig&#62;
	&#60;alias&#62;
		&#60;family&#62;serif&#60;/family&#62;
		&#60;prefer&#62;
		&#60;family&#62;Liberation Serif&#60;/family&#62;
		&#60;/prefer&#62;
	&#60;/alias&#62;
&#60;/fontconfig&#62;</code></pre>

						<pre><code>fonts.fontconfig.defaultFonts = {
	serif = [ "Liberation Serif" ];
	sansSerif = [ "Liberation Sans" ];
	monospace = [ "Victor Mono" ];
};</code></pre>
						<p>
						Note that this will <em>not</em> install font
						packages for you. There is a separate
						<code>fonts.fonts</code> option where you list
						each package out.
						</p>

							<h3 id="reproducible-builds">Pro #2: Reproducible builds</h3>

							<p>
							Reproducibility and deterministic behavior
							are dense topics. When it comes to NixOS,
							the idea is that it&#8217;s easy to recreate
							a given system configuration. You can copy
							<code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code>
							over to a different machine and build from
							it. Assuming that file contains valid Nix
							expressions, it should yield the same system
							state.
							</p>

							<p>
							This means that NixOS is a good Linux
							distribution for cloud servers, as reliable
							system deployment is straightforward and
							built into the OS itself. Additionally, Nix
							itself is a powerful collaborative tool
							because creating a development environment
							with the same version of important libraries
							is relatively easy to do.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 id="atomic-rollbacks">Pro #3: Atomic upgrades</h3>

							<p>
							Another really helpful feature Nix
							developers included is the avoidance of
							partial states. When software is designed
							around this principle, either everything
							takes effect or nothing does. This is also
							known as <em>atomicity</em>.
							</p>

							<p>
							Upgrading NixOS is an atomic transaction.
							Here&#8217;s a practical example of how that
							can be useful: if a power outage happens
							during a rebuild, the packages are still in
							a consistent state. The system will either
							use the entire working set of packages from
							before or after.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 id="rollbacks">Pro #4: Rollbacks</h3>

							<p>
							&#8220;Generations&#8221; are a key feature
							of NixOS. If you mess something up, you can
							roll back to a previous working
							configuration. The boot loader includes a
							list of generations to select from as well.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 id="immutability">Pro #5: Immutability</h3>

							<p>
							Packages are installed in unique locations
							within the Nix store
							(<code>/nix/store</code>), and always remain
							the same once built. The subdirectory for
							each package is derived from a cryptographic
							hash of its build dependency graph.
							</p>

							<p>
							Setting the jargon aside, this means you can
							easily use multiple versions of the same
							software&#8212;actually, this even applies
							to identical versions with different build
							dependencies/flags as far as I know.
							</p>
						</section>

					<section>
						<h3 id="learning-curve">Con #1: The learning curve</h3>

						<p>
						To manage your system effectively, you&#8217;ll
						need to invest some time and effort into
						learning Nix and related tools. After all, most
						of the system configuration you would perform by
						hand with another Linux distro is instead handled
						with a programming language.
						</p>

						<p>
						Here&#8217;s my recommendation: experiment with
						Nix and see how you feel about it before
						installing NixOS on bare metal. You&#8217;ll
						want to check the
						<a
							href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-language.html"
							hreflang="en"
							rel="nofollow"
						>Nix language guide</a>
						and follow along to get a sense of how the
						language works.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 id="security-concerns">Con #2: Some security concerns</h3>

						<p>
						It&#8217;s always a good idea to see what open
						issues a software project has before using
						it&#8212;especially those pertaining to
						security. Here are a few issues in the
						<a
							href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs"
							hreflang="en"
						>nixpkgs repository</a>
						to consider before using NixOS.
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
							<a
								href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/24288"
								hreflang="en"
								rel="nofollow"
							>World-readable secrets inside the Nix store</a>
							</li>

							<li>
							<a
								href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/11908"
								hreflang="en"
								rel="nofollow"
							>Many NixOS services needlessly run as root</a>
							</li>

							<li>
							<a
								href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/121293"
								hreflang="en"
								rel="nofollow"
							>chmod leaves opportunity to leak secrets</a>
							</li>

							<li>
							<a
								href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/156400"
								hreflang="en"
								rel="nofollow"
							>Secrets provided in arguments are exposed to unprivileged users</a>
							</li>

							<li>
							<a
								href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/55370"
								hreflang="en"
								rel="nofollow"
							>nobody/nogroup shouldn't be used</a>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
						Of course, every software project of notable
						size and scope has <em>some</em> security
						issues. Decide for yourself what an acceptable
						threshold is. You might also consult the
						<a
							href="https://nixos.org/community/teams/security.html"
							hreflang="en"
							rel="nofollow"
						>NixOS security page</a>.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 id="requires-systemd">Con #3: Requires systemd</h3>

						<p>
						<a
							href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/126797"
							hreflang="en"
							rel="nofollow"
						>NixOS depends on systemd</a>. There&#8217;s no
						option to use something different like OpenRC or
						runit. This will probably remain the case for
						the foreseeable future.
						</p>

						<p>
						If you&#8217;re fine with using a Linux
						distribution that has systemd, then perhaps this
						isn&#8217;t a concern for you. All the same, one
						drawback of NixOS is that it doesn&#8217;t enjoy
						the level of freedom that something like Gentoo
						has in this regard.
						</p>

					<h2 id="conclusion">Concluding my NixOS review</h2>

					<p>
					Every system has its strengths and weaknesses,
					whether it&#8217;s a Linux distro or otherwise.
					Software is a tool: to select the right tool for the
					job, you need to first understand the problem
					you&#8217;re looking to solve.
					</p>

					<p>
					I hope that my NixOS review has given you some
					reasons to explore the Nix ecosystem, as well as
					some knowledge to arm yourself with when you do so.
					Assuming the benefits were compelling to you and the
					drawbacks seem like things you can live with, you
					may as well give it a try. Experience is one of the
					best ways to learn.
