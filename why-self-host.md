# Benefits and drawbacks of self-hosting

Last updated: August 19th, 2024

As someone that has run many of my own services for a while now, I feel
that I can speak to the advantages and disadvantages of self-hosting. In
my case, the benefits have more than made up for the drawbacks, but I
think that the question of whether it's worth it to self-host is
something that each person or organization has to answer for themselves. 

## Benefits

- Learning more about system administration and software stacks by
  building it yourself. There are few better teachers than hands-on
  experience. When I first started, I didn't even know what an A record
  was, but now I know much more about networking and cybersecurity.

- Control and choice. For instance, you can decide what operating system
  will be used. Often there are multiple choices of software available
  for particular use cases (web servers immediately come to mind), and
  the configuration details are all up to you as well.

- Transparency. Software that can be self-hosted is usually open source
  software. Because you assembled the pieces, how everything fits
  together is more readily apparent. That means that if something goes
  wrong, at least there's some idea of where to start looking.

- Repairability. If something is broken, you can fix it yourself without
  waiting for someone else to get to it.

- Privacy. This is related to some of the other points, in that because
  you have control and transparency, it's possible to know how sensitive
  data is being processed and what parties it's being exposed to.

## Drawbacks

- It takes time. Learning the necessary skills and setting everything up
  at the beginning takes patience, and the time investment doesn't end
  there. Regular system maintenance is a part of managing your own
  server. It involves making sure that everything is still functioning
  correctly and performing upgrades, among other things.

- Responsibility. You are responsible for everything that happens on
  your server. If it breaks, no one else is going to fix it. Sometimes
  this is a real inconvenience because things have a way of breaking at
  inopportune times, but this is the tradeoff for having more power and
  control.

- It usually costs money to self-host. Recurring costs for a virtual
  private server and domain name can really add up over time. But these
  may be less than the costs you would otherwise pay for cloud
  computing, so context matters here.

- Risk of creating an insecure environment. If you don't know what
  you're doing, it's entirely possible to create vulnerabilities without
  even realizing it. This is why it's important to take your time and
  acquire the knowledge needed to do things right. Starting small also
  helps (for example, there's not much risk in hosting a static website
  to start out with).
