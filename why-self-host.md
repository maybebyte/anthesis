# Benefits and drawbacks of self-hosting

Last updated: July 7th, 2025

As someone who has run many services for a while now, I feel I can speak
to the advantages and disadvantages of self-hosting. In my case, the
benefits have more than made up for the drawbacks. However, each person
or organization must decide whether self-hosting is worth it for
themselves.

## Benefits

- **Learning more about system administration and software stacks** by
  building it yourself. Few teachers beat hands-on experience. When I
  first started, I didn't even know what an A record was (for those who
  don't already know, an A record is a DNS (Domain Name System) record
  that maps a domain to an IP address). Now I know much more about
  networking and cybersecurity.
- **Control and choice.** For instance, you can decide what operating
  system to use. Often multiple software choices exist for particular use
  cases (web servers immediately come to mind), and you control all the
  configuration details.
- **Transparency.** Software that can be self-hosted typically uses open
  source code. Because you assembled the pieces, how everything fits
  together becomes more apparent. That means when something goes wrong,
  you have some idea of where to start looking.
- **Repairability.** When something breaks, you can fix it yourself
  without waiting for someone else to get to it.
- **Privacy.** This relates to the other points---because you have
  control and transparency, you can know how the system processes
  sensitive data and what parties gain access to it.

## Drawbacks

- **Time investment.** Learning the necessary skills and setting
  everything up initially takes patience, and the time investment doesn't
  end there. Regular system maintenance is part of managing your own
  server. This involves making sure everything still functions correctly
  and performing upgrades, among other tasks.
- **Full responsibility.** You bear responsibility for everything that
  happens on your server. If it breaks, no one else will fix it. Sometimes
  this creates real inconvenience because things tend to break at
  inopportune times. This is the tradeoff for having more power and
  control.
- **Ongoing costs.** Self-hosting typically costs money. Recurring costs
  for a virtual private server and domain name can add up over time. But
  these may cost less than what you would otherwise pay for cloud
  computing, so context matters here.
- **Security risk.** If you don't know what you're doing, you can create
  vulnerabilities without even realizing it. This is why taking your time
  and acquiring the knowledge needed to do things right matters. Starting
  small also helps (for example, hosting a static website to start carries
  little risk).
