## What was the meaning of "a missing link?"

I think of it this way: when something goes missing, you find it in the
last place you look. I figured "a missing link" could represent a
website someone hasn't visited yet. There's a certain feeling you can
experience when you stumble upon a link to something, select it, and end
up appreciating what you found. I hoped people would experience that
feeling when they discovered this website, and I still do.

## What's the meaning of "anthesis?"

Anthesis refers to the time when a flower opens fully and functions, or
the beginning of that time. Another way to express this concept is
"blossoming" or "blooming."

As a metaphor, anthesis holds significance for me because I've searched
for my path for a long time. In the past, I felt my life lacked
brightness. Fortunately, these days I have more of what's necessary to
grow.

I don't think blossoming means life's difficult aspects disappear
permanently. Sometimes it still seems like there isn't enough light, and
storms still rage from time to time. These things arrive, stay for a
while, and eventually fade away.

In my eyes, to flourish means understanding that nothing stays the same.
Embracing challenges. Remembering to choose this way of approaching life
over avoiding, denying, or excessive controlling. Coming back home every
time you find yourself lost somewhere else.

If there were only clear, sunny days, there would be no rain. Without
rain, there would be no growth. In other words... when enough struggle
and enough support both exist at the same time, there also exists the
opportunity for anthesis.
