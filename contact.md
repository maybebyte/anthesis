# How to contact me

Last updated: July 4th, 2025

## Email

You can find my email address stored here in plaintext. I avoid linking
to it directly as a basic form of spam mitigation (otherwise the average
bot can scrape the page contents and try to send me unwanted emails).

## My public GPG key

I prefer to receive email encrypted with [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/)
(GNU Privacy Guard) when possible so that the contents remain private.
But you can send unencrypted email to me as well.

Here is the fingerprint for [my public
key](/pubkeys/F1B59F496EE704B0.asc) if you know how to
use GPG and want to send me an encrypted email.

Also, please remember to attach your public key so that I can send an
encrypted reply.
