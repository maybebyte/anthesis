# FLOSS OS recommendations

[![A three panel comic strip from xkcd. It's titled "How Standards Proliferate" with a subheading of "See: A/C chargers, character encodings, instant messaging, etc." The first panel says "Situation: there are 14 competing standards." The second panel features two stick figures talking to one another, a man on the left and a woman on the right. The man says to the woman, "14?! Ridiculous! We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use cases." The woman replies, "Yeah!" The third panel has a box in the top left hand corner that says, "Soon:", and the main text says, "Situation: There are 15 competing standards." ](/images/xkcd-standards.6975f55c09cec9a24ccb0185707d56892b881f9b1157c3e6d7ff61554d91ba94.2.png)](/images/xkcd-standards.6975f55c09cec9a24ccb0185707d56892b881f9b1157c3e6d7ff61554d91ba94.2.png)

The above [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/927/) illustrates a particular
mindset that is responsible for the wealth of Linux distributions
targeted at users new to the platform. Given this, I don't have a
one-size-fits-all recommendation; each user has different needs, so
pigeonholing is counterproductive. For instance, someone that feels more
comfortable with an interface akin to macOS could have a bad time with
[Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php), even though Linux
Mint is a great OS for many people.

However, I'll share a quiz I find helpful, as well as what works for
me.

## Generate recommendations from a quiz

Check out [LibreHunt](https://librehunt.org/). LibreHunt does a good job
of explaining the merits of FLOSS and suggests Linux distributions based
on how the questionnaire is answered.

## What I use

I like OpenBSD. See ["Why OpenBSD?"](/why-openbsd.html) for more details.

## Other devices to liberate

### Smartphone

It's best to use a privacy respecting OS here, too.
[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is what I use, although
[LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) supports a wider range of
hardware.

### Router

A router is a computer too. Proprietary consumer firmware isn't
exceedingly capable, nor is it secure. DD-WRT, OpenWRT, pfSense, and
OpenBSD are all much better options. If flashing firmware onto a
consumer router, use Ethernet and take the appropriate precautions.

Check out [Building an OpenBSD router](/openbsd-router.html) for more
information on how I approach it.
