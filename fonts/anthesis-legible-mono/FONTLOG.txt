# FONTLOG for Anthesis Legible Mono

This file provides detailed information on Anthesis Legible Mono. If you
create a derivative work, please include this file along with the fonts.
Update it each time you make a change to the fonts.

## Basic font information

Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono provides the foundation for Anthesis Legible
Sans. The creators of Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono specifically designed
their typeface to improve legibility.

To improve font loading performance and reduce bandwidth consumption on
the web, the `subset_fonts.py` script subsetted Anthesis Legible Mono
and split it into separate font files. You can find that script here:

https://github.com/maybebyte/subset_fonts

### More about subset_fonts.py

`subset_fonts.py` splits fonts into Roman and Italic variants, then
further divides them by the font's supported character ranges:

- Latin
- Latin Extended
- Cyrillic
- Cyrillic Extended
- Greek
- Greek Extended
- Vietnamese
- Vietnamese Extended
- Other

`subset_fonts.py` also provides a "critical text" variant to support a
Critical Flash Of Faux Text (Critical FOFT) implementation. You can find
more details here:
