# FONTLOG for Anthesis Gravitas Sans

This file provides detailed information on Anthesis Gravitas Sans. If
you create a derivative work, please include this file along with the
fonts. Update it each time you make a change to the fonts.

## Basic font information

IBM Plex Sans provides the foundation for Anthesis Gravitas Sans. The
creators of IBM Plex Sans specifically designed their typeface as part
of IBM's comprehensive design language, emphasizing clarity,
functionality, and modern aesthetics suitable for both digital and print
applications.

To improve font loading performance and reduce bandwidth consumption on
the web, the `subset_fonts.py` script subsetted Anthesis Gravitas Sans
and split it into separate font files. You can find that script here:

https://github.com/maybebyte/subset_fonts

### More about subset_fonts.py

`subset_fonts.py` splits fonts into Roman and Italic variants, then
further divides them by the font's supported character ranges:

- Latin
- Latin Extended
- Cyrillic
- Cyrillic Extended
- Greek
- Greek Extended
- Vietnamese
- Vietnamese Extended
- Other

`subset_fonts.py` also provides a "critical text" variant to support a
Critical Flash Of Faux Text (Critical FOFT) implementation. You can find
more details here:
