# Local authoritative DNS on OpenBSD using dhcpd(8) and unbound(8)

_Tested on OpenBSD 7.0_

One meaningful addition to home networks is the ability to refer to
devices using domain names instead of IP addresses. Domain names are
more memorable and human readable. Local authoritative DNS allows things
like this to work:

    $ host peterepeat
    peterepeat.home.arpa has address 192.168.1.241

    $ ping -c 1 peterepeat
    PING peterepeat.home.arpa (192.168.1.241): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.241: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.395 ms

    --- peterepeat.home.arpa ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
    round-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 0.395/0.395/0.395/0.000 ms

Understand that this document makes some assumptions. Primarily, that
there is [a router running OpenBSD](/openbsd-router.html) that serves
DHCP and DNS with [`dhcpd(8)`](https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd) and
[`unbound(8)`](https://man.openbsd.org/unbound). Local authoritative DNS
is an extension to this setup.

## RFC8375 (why we use home.arpa.)

Often people will choose a domain name for their home network on a whim,
something like `localdomain` or `lan`. I used `lan` for a while. It
turns out there is a special-use domain name explicitly reserved for
this purpose: `home.arpa.` ([Check out RFC8375 for more
information](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8375)).

Now that a domain name is decided, let's get to using it.

## Configuring unbound(8)

Unbound is mostly known as a caching recursive resolver. However, it
can also serve zones authoritatively,[^1] as indicated by this commented out
section in the default configuration file.

    # Serve zones authoritatively from Unbound to resolver clients.
    # Not for external service.
    #
    #local-zone: "local." static
    #local-data: "mycomputer.local. IN A 192.0.2.51"
    #local-zone: "2.0.192.in-addr.arpa." static
    #local-data-ptr: "192.0.2.51 mycomputer.local"

I prefer to include a separate file in
[`unbound.conf(5)`](https://man.openbsd.org/unbound.conf) so that this
part of the configuration is distinct. Edit
`/var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf` and place the desired file name in there
somewhere.

    include: /var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf.lan

After writing those changes, create the included file and add these contents to
it. Be sure to adjust things as needed. Unbound already includes RFC8375
support, so only `local-data` and `local-data-ptr` need to be added.

    # This is where individual hosts are defined. Both an A record and a PTR
    # record are needed. It is no coincidence that local-data-ptr is the
    # reverse of local-data.
    local-data: "peterepeat.home.arpa. IN A 192.168.1.241"
    local-data-ptr: 192.168.1.241 peterepeat.home.arpa"

Save the file. Check that the syntax is sane (unbound will check the
syntax of the included file, too).

    # unbound-checkconf
    unbound-checkconf: no errors in /var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf

## Configuring dhcpd(8)

A viable [dhcpd.conf(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.conf) will need
to declare a domain name and at least one host, in addition to mandatory
parameters. A working configuration could look like this (note that
`fixed-address` is given a domain name, not an IP address).

    subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    	option domain-name "home.arpa";
    	option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
    	option routers 192.168.1.1;
    	range 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.200;

    	host peterepeat {
    		fixed-address peterepeat.home.arpa;
    		hardware ethernet 34:cb:02:02:2c:0a;
    		option host-name "peterepeat";
    	}
    }

I prefer to add `use-host-decl-names` to assign the hostname
automatically based on the host declaration like so.

    subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    	option domain-name "home.arpa";
    	option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
    	option routers 192.168.1.1;
    	range 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.200;

    	group {
    		use-host-decl-names on;

    		host peterepeat {
    			fixed-address peterepeat.home.arpa;
    			hardware ethernet 34:cb:02:02:2c:0a;
    		}
    	}
    }

Check that dhcpd is happy with the configuration. If there are no
complaints, we can restart both daemons.

    # dhcpd -n
    # rcctl restart dhcpd unbound

## Testing DNS resolution

Obtain a new DHCP lease on the client side (as of OpenBSD 6.9, this can
be done with [dhcpleasectl(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpleasectl.8).
The correct interface will vary).

    # dhcpleasectl re0

Then, try to resolve the new hostname.

    $ host peterepeat.home.arpa
    peterepeat.home.arpa has address 192.168.1.241
    $ host 192.168.1.241
    241.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer peterepeat.home.arpa.

## Querying hosts without a FQDN

This setup works well enough as is, but it may not be possible to query
hosts without a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) out of the box. Check
to see if [`host(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/host) fails with a partial
hostname.

    $ host peterepeat
    Host peterepeat not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

This happens because `.home.arpa` is not being appended to `peterepeat`
before the lookup. The machine trying to perform the lookup needs to
have this line added to
[`resolv.conf(5)`](https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf).

    domain home.arpa

Now things work as expected, saving a few keystrokes.

    $ host peterepeat
    peterepeat.home.arpa has address 192.168.1.241

[^1]:
    [`nsd(8)`](https://man.openbsd.org/nsd) can also fulfill this
    function if lookups to `home.arpa.` are forwarded to it with unbound,
    but it's a more involved setup. RFC8375 states that it is permissible
    to combine the recursive resolver function for general DNS lookups
    with an authoritative resolver for `home.arpa.`
