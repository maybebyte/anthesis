# Projects I'm working on

**NOTE (2025-07-16)**: Not all projects are currently available on
anthes.is. I aim to fix this in the future, but for now you can visit
[my GitHub page](https://github.com/maybebyte) if you want to explore
all the code I've published online.

I publish the source code of my projects here and on GitHub.

Here, [stagit](https://github.com/oxalorg/stagit) generates HyperText
Markup Language (HTML) pages from git repositories.
